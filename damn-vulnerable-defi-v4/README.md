# Damn Vulnerable DeFi v4

A training ground for security researchers, developers, and educators to dive into smart contract security.

It contains challenges featuring flashloans, price oracles, governance, NFTs, DEXs, lending pools, smart contract wallets, timelocks, vaults, meta-transactions, token distributions, upgradeability, and more!

Instructions, contracts, and other information are in [the repository](https://github.com/theredguild/damn-vulnerable-defi/tree/v4.1.0)

## Rules

- You must always use the player account.
- You must not modify the challenges' initial nor final conditions.
- You can code and deploy your own smart contracts.
- You can use Foundry's cheatcodes to advance time when necessary.
- You can import external libraries that aren't installed, although it shouldn't be necessary.
